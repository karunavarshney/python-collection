# python-collection

Write a Python function frequency(l) that takes as input a list of integers and returns a pair of the form (minfreqlist,maxfreqlist) where
 - minfreqlist is a list of numbers with minimum frequency in l, sorted in ascending order
 - maxfreqlist is a list of numbers with maximum frequency in l, sorted in ascending
For instance
>>> frequency([13,12,11,13,14,13,7,11,13,14,12])
([7], [13])
